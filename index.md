## Time Series Data Mining with Python

The Western Australian Branch of the Statistical Society of Australia ([SSA WA](https://www.statsoc.org.au/Western-Australia)) is delighted to host this hands-on Python workshop on the analysis of time series data. It's our privilege to have the 2021 Frank Hansford-Miller Fellow, Dr Manuel Herrera, as the instructor.

This two-day workshop aims to enable students and practitioners in data science to add methodologies of time series data mining to their skillset for future applications for both academic and industry projects. After an introduction to Python for time series analysis, this workshop explores data mining techniques for pattern extraction in time series, ranging from dimensionality reduction to anomaly detection. Participants will benefit from data wrangling for time series analysis with Python on the first day and a practical overview of time series data mining tools on the second day.

## Registration

Workshop participants must first register on the SSA Events page: <https://www.statsoc.org.au/event-4528724>

## Slack

Links to Zoom sessions will be distributed via the Slack workspace for this workshop. Slack is also the place to ask for assistance and continue any discussions that have arisen throughout the workshop. The Slack will remain activated for six months after the event (and perhaps longer).

## Schedule

The online workshop is structured as 4 x 2h sessions over two consecutive afternoons:

|  Day   | Session | Time        | Content                        |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| 18 Nov | 1       | 1:30pm (2h) | Introduction to Python         |

|        | 4       | 4:00pm (2h) | Matrix Profile and Other tools |

## Materials

The workshop is designed as a Python Notebook than can be run with the cloud service Colaboratory ('Colab'), this allows you to write and execute Python in your browser without needing to setup a local Python environment. For more information visit the [Google Colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index). 

Links to materials will be posted here as they become available.

## Curriculum

### Day 1 - Fundamentals of Time Series Analysis with Python

This is a hands-on course for learning the basics of data wrangling and time series analysis with Python.

We will begin the course with a quick introduction to Python and the Google Colab environment which runs a Jupyter Notebook service for executing Python code in a web browser with no little user setup. We will then explore the use of libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy` and `matplotlib` to data acquisition, timestamping, preprocessing and visualization. We will continue the session by introducing the fundamentals of time series analysis. Throughout the workshop you will gain experience implementing these analysis in Python in real-life case studies.

At the end of this module you will be able to:
* Get familiar with Python and the Google Colab environment.
* Use the Python libraries `pandas` and `matplotlib` to import, preprocessing, and data visualisation.
* Work on time series data analysis with the Python libraries `pandas` and `statsmodels`.

### Day 2 - Introduction to Time Series Data Mining

This workshop will introduce time series data mining techniques using Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) with the specifically dedicated Python library `saxpy`, as well as with `tslearn` which provides more general machine learning tools for the analysis of time series data. We will see the benefits of the data dimension reduction using SAX, as well as its possibilities on the application further of clustering and classification techniques.

Matrix profile is a more advanced technique than SAX for time-series data mining. The workshop will introduce its theoretical basics while using the Python library `matrixprofile` for motif and novelty/discord discovery. The first, aiding to extract the most common patterns in a time series and the latter, to detect points and subsequences of potential anomalies. Other data mining problems, such as clustering and shapelet discovery for time series classification, will also be explored.

This session covers:
* Use the Python library `saxpy` to work with SAX on time-series dimension reduction, clustering and classification.
* Explore the Python library `tslearn` for basic analysis based on SAX as well as for other machine learning techniques for time series.
* Work on time-series data mining using matrix profile and the Python library `matrixprofile`.
* Matrix profile analysis will include the discovery of time series discords that will lead to new possibilities for anomaly detection.
